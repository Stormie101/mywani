                You know it and I know it, Hanis's nikkah day was one of the highlight of our date last year<br>
                We spend so many day and night thinking what to wear and I even buy a new shirt for it!<br>
                They did well during their nikkah and it somehow make us more motivated when it's our turn<br>
                After her nikkah, we get to spend some time at midvalley to karaoke and walk around there<br>
                Even though I have to do some work for a while but it's so fun! I absolutely love it!
